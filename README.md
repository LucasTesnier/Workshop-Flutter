# Workshop-Flutter
The Flutter workshop

# Flutter Configuration

Please come to the workshop with Android studio and flutter sdk install.

Follow this link : https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

You don't have to follow the games on phones and emulators, this will be done during the Workshop.

# WorkShop steps

## Step 1
### Discover the Android studio IDE.

After opening the android studio IDE, you can observe that some code is already present. This is an example project provided by Flutter. We will start by trying to deploy it to a virtual machine. Note that it is possible to use your own wired telephone. However this Workshop will focus only on the use of an emulator.

At the top left of the screen you will have all the tools needed to build and deploy your project. While on the left, you will find the file explorer. In the center of the screen, you can add or modify code. A lambda idea.

First we will launch the creation of a new emulator. This operation may take some time, I invite you to remain patient.

Go to the Tool tab, AVD Manager then click on Create virtual Device

Click on the phone model of your choice, next and download the corresponding OS (usually one to two minutes). Then click on next until you reach the end of the configuration. Feel free to edit them as you wish.

Then launch the emulator. It will then initialize (Count 30 seconds to a minute in general)

To finish this first step, click on the green arrow to launch the build and deployment of the sample project. Congratulations, you have successfully used a Flutter project!

## Step 2
### A stunning image

Now that you can observe your application, let's try to make it a little prettier. Include an image!

I am at your disposal if you ever encounter difficulties or if you cannot find a track, good luck!

Don't forget to modify the pubspec.yaml :eyes:

## Step 3
### Say click, it's magic

Isn't your app prettier now?

However, I find that the + button is too much... let's try to merge it with our new image!

Make the counter increment when we click on the image and remove the + button!

I won't give you a clue this time, so to your Man (The flutter doc is really extensive)

## Step 4
### Polishing

Great, your cookie shop will soon be operational! Make some visual changes to make it more attractive!

Modify the background, change the texts, the images etc... feel free to modify everything you want

## Step 5
### Make some profit

Now that our store is up and running, let's have customers spend their cookies. To do this, start by expanding the store by creating a new page...

Be careful, the operation can be a bit complicated. Document yourself on Navigator and on Material Page Route

## Step 6
### Watch out for loss!

Attention, currently your shop does not know the number of cookies possessed by the customer. Not very convenient for shopping...

Try to understand how to pass data between two pages. (Maybe with the builder of this page ?)

Ask about the "Widget" to pass your data in your classes :)

## Final Step
### Make a real Game !

Congratulations, your shop is starting to have a great success! Now try to improve it by adding passive generation, slider customization or even graphical styling. Why not music?
