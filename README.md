# Workshop-Flutter
The Flutter workshop

# Flutter Configuration

# WorkShop steps

## Step 1
### Discover the Android studio IDE.

After opening the android studio IDE, you can observe that some code is already present. This is an example project provided by Flutter. We will start by trying to deploy it to a virtual machine. Note that it is possible to use your own wired telephone. However this Workshop will focus only on the use of an emulator.

At the top left of the screen you will have all the tools needed to build and deploy your project. While on the left, you will find the file explorer. In the center of the screen, you can add or modify code. A lambda idea.

First we will launch the creation of a new emulator. This operation may take some time, I invite you to remain patient.

Go to the Tool tab, AVD Manager then click on Create virtual Device

Click on the phone model of your choice, next and download the corresponding OS (usually one to two minutes). Then click on next until you reach the end of the configuration. Feel free to edit them as you wish.

Then launch the emulator. It will then initialize (Count 30 seconds to a minute in general)

To finish this first step, click on the green arrow to launch the build and deployment of the sample project. Congratulations, you have successfully used a Flutter project!
